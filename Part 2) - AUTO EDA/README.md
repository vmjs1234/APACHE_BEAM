# Auto EDA

This project demonstrates automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce customer service satisfaction dataset using advanced profiling tools.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the E-commerce Customer Service Satisfaction dataset, which can be found on Kaggle:

## Automated EDA Tools

### Sweetviz
This project utilizes Sweetviz, an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA with a single line of code. Sweetviz creates a self-contained HTML report that includes various data summaries and visualizations.

### Profiling
In addition to Sweetviz, this project employs other profiling techniques - Pandas Profiler to provide comprehensive insights into the dataset. These profiling tools help in understanding the structure, content, and relationships within the data, making it easier to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential areas for further investigation.

The combination of Sweetviz and Pandas profiler offers a robust and efficient approach to automated EDA, allowing for quick and thorough exploration of the e-commerce customer service satisfaction data.
